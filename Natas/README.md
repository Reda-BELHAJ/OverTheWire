# The Natas Wargame

[Natas](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) teaches the basics of serverside web-security.

Each level of natas consists of its own website located at http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org, where ***X*** is the level number. There is no SSH login. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.
