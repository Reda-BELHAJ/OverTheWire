```php
<?
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
}
?>
```
By analysing the php script we see that the filter is not being sanitize. Therefore, we can inject additional commands like "ls"
